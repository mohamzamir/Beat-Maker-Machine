# Beat Maker Machine

Beat Maker Machine is an innovative web application that offers users a fun and engaging game similar to the classic Light and Sound Memory game. The primary functionality involves a user interface where the user must remember and replicate a series of patterns involving lighted buttons to create a beat. This game utilizes the JavaScript library, AudioContext, to generate the unique sounds associated with each button.

## Installation

Please follow these instructions to install the Beat Maker Machine project.

 ## Usage
